#  Donner

This is a WIP iOS app to track lightning. Tap a button when you see lightning, tap it again when you hear it. Donner will tell you how far away it is.

You can also enable location services and point your phone in the direction of what you see and/or hear. It will track multiple strikes on a map and show you how the storm is moving.
